                <p>Our work on tactile displays involves research on characterizing the properties of different actuators used
                    in displays, building and testing different types of tactile displays, evaluating the mechanical properties of
                    skin so as to quantify its responses to vibration and psychophysical studies in which we measure
                    perceptual responses to mechanical stimulation of the skin. </p>
        
                <p>We have built displays that can be mounted on the hand, arm, leg or torso and have shown that by varying the 
                spatial and temporal properties of vibrotactile stimulation we can create tactile communication systems. </p>

                    <p>Different actuator technologies have been used to create tactile displays in our lab including linear resonant 
                        actuators, voice coil motors, piezoelectric actuators, shape memory alloy actuators and magnetorheological fluid 
                        (MRF) actuators. The latter is a joint project with collaborators at the University of Pisa. The actuators vary 
                        with respect 
                        to their bandwidth, response times, capacity to generate different waveform profiles and power requirements. 
                        Analyses of their characteristics are important to the design of tactile displays in that they indicate which 
                        motors are optimal for specific applications and how the conditions under which the motors make contact with 
                        the skin can have a profound effect on the mechanical inputs delivered.

                        Tactile displays have been evaluated at different locations on the body including the hand, arm, thigh and torso.
                        We have measured the travelling waves on the skin elicited by vibration of the motors and determined how they
                        vary at different locations and as a function of the mechanical properties of skin.
                        There are differences among the sites tested and some features of tactile
                        sensory processing such as tactile anisotropies influence the ability to identify tactile patterns at some
                        locations (on the arm) but not others (the back).

                        </div>
<p>
                        Tactile patterns that are used to communicate via wearable tactile displays are often called tactons, by analogy to
                        icons in the visual modality. As they are conceptual, the association between the tactile signal and the concept it
                        represents must be learned. Tactons
                        can be created by varying the frequency, waveform, intensity and duration of the vibration. Psychophysical studies
                        have indicated that variations in the temporal profile and the location on the body stimulated are the easiest
                        parameters for people to discriminate. Spatial cues
                        appear to be a particularly
                        effective dimension for creating tactons when the display is distrubuted across the skin surface.
                    
                        We have also demonstrated that tactons can be used to convey navigational cues such as turn arround, turn right or stop, and that these can 
                        be attended to and accurately identified during concurrent cognitive and physical acitivites.

                        In our research on thermal displays, we have developed thermal models that characterize 
                        the interaction between the hand and an object. We have assessed the validity of the models 
                        using both physiological and psychophysical data.</p>
                    <p>We have also designed and built 
                        displays to study whether thermal cues can be used to encode abstract information, 
                        such as changes in pressure or distance and to study multisensory processing.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Thermal displays based on Peltier devices have been built to simulate the changes in skin
                    temperature that occur when the hand makes contact with an object. The objective of these
                    displays is to present thermal cues to the hand that facilitate object recognition in virtual
                    environments or in teleoperated robotic systems. We have shown that the ability to identify 
                    and discriminate between materials based on thermal cues presented via the display is similar 
                    to that achieved using real materials. Evaluation of these displays has involved both 
                    psychophysical and physiological studies so that the models implemented can be rigorously 
                    evaluated.

                </div>
                <p>The thermal sensory system differs in many ways from the sense of touch particularly with respect
                    to spatial and temporal processing. For example, when a larger area of skin is heated or cooled 
                    the stimulus is not perceived as being bigger but as more intense. Thermal spatial acuity is
                    markedly inferior to tactile spatial resolution.  However, the pervasive belief regarding 
                    the poor localization of the thermal senses was brought into question by our finding that 
                    the spatial and temporal interactions that characterize the tactile senses also occur for 
                    thermal stimuli.  We have demonstrated that the perceived location of a thermal stimulus can 
                    be made to change as a function of the temporal interval between successive thermal stimuli.

                </div>
                <p>We are exploring whether thermal interfaces can be used to enhance user interactions with digital 
                    media or be incorporated into multisensory displays. For this purpose, thermal patterns have been
                    created by varying the direction, amplitude and rate of temperature change. Small sets of these 
                    thermal icons can be readily identified with little training. There are differences in performance 
                    depending on whether the thermal display is in contact with the wrist, the palm of the hand or the 
                    fingers, with the latter site demonstrating the poorest performance. This research also entails 
                    developing models of the thermal interaction between the thermal display and the skin so that 
                    the icons can be optimally designed.

                <p>The mechanical properties of the skin can have a profound influence on the signals 
                    detected by mechanoreceptors in the skin. For example, the glabrous skin on the palm
                     is much stiffer than the hairy skin on the forearm and so the actual frequency of 
                     vibration of a motor on the skin will differ substantially between the two sites.</p>
                <p>Our research program aims to understand how the properties of skin influence its 
                     response to thermal and tactile stimulation. We have built a number of skin 
                     mechanical testing systems and developed associated analytic tools for this purpose.</p>

                    <p>
                        The goal of this research program is to understand how the mechanical properties of skin
                        affect the mechanical and thermal inputs delivered via various actuator technologies.
                        We have fabricated accelerometer arrays to measure the vibration at the position of the
                        actuator and the propagation of surface waves from this location across the skin. These
                        waves can influence the ability to localize a point of stimulation in a tactile display.
                        We have found that there are significant differences in the frequency and amplitude of
                        oscillation of an actuator depending on whether it is mounted on glabrous or hairy skin
                        and that surface waves can be detected 25 mm from the initial point of stimulation. We
                        have also developed a dynamic mechanical testing device that measures the linear dynamics
                        of the skin and quantified the greater stiffness and damping of glabrous as compared
                        to hairy skin.

                    <p>
                        In designing both tactile and thermal displays it is important to tailor the device to
                        the area of skin on which it will be mounted and to understand why the same input may
                        not be perceived similarly at different sites on the body. For this purpose, we have
                        measured the surface roughness of the finger pad so that it can be incorporated in our
                        thermal models of hand-object interactions and found that it leads to better predictions
                        of the changes in skin temperature. With our skin mechanical testing devices, we have
                        measured the mechanical properties of skin and determined how these change across the
                        body and with varying levels of skin hydration.

                    <p>
                        When we haptically explore an object, information about its properties arises from finger
                        movements that impose forces on the object and indicate its shape and properties such as
                        weight, compliance or material composition. The forces used during manual exploration
                        vary as a function of the property being perceived. We have measured how skin temperature
                        changes with contact force and surface area related these to the perception of the spatial
                        properties of stimuli. We have also analyzed the displacement and force of movements
                        made when perceiving stiffness or viscosity.
